I finally have my main computer dual-booting XP and Ubuntu with a wireless internet connection. The secret- [LinuxAntâ€™s Drive Loader](http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/) I answer some questions, pop in my DLink CD, get a one-month trial key, and I have working wireless internet on Linux. Now I just have to find a free solution.
