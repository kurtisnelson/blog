Office 2007 is a major improvement over the old office. With the ribbon interface, you can now find what you want and can work much quicker. File sizes are now cut in half with the new XML format. It runs smoothly on all systems, and still retains its power features while exposing them more and making them easier to use. I recomend with no reservations Office 2007, and consider it worth upgrading to from an old version.
