I found a cool new advertising tool via [AskTheAdmin](http://asktheadmin.com) called Entrecard. It is basically an affiliate network, but with credits required to advertise on other sites. I already have a line of people signed up to appear on my site, and hope to increase my traffic by appearing on some other blogs. I do wish that they would let you monetize somehow from it by offering paid ads. When you sign up, you upload an image to have appear on the cards everywhere, drop some code in your template where you want it, and are done. Maybe I can sell some more webhosting this way?
