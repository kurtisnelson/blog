As someone who teaches a (12-week) magical bootcamp, I totally agree. What really differentiates our grads from the competion is that we are very careful about who we accept into the program, knowing very well that not every human being is cut out to be a developer.

I personally look for people who have shown aptitude for complex systems in a different context, be it operating a legacy computer system used for tracking packages, being a certified hardware repair tech, or having successfully built simple software completely on their own.
