The healthiest side effect of the startup exodus is the most obvious one: people will no longer move across the world to SF just because they want to do a startup, but because they actually want to be in this city and the bay area.

If fresh college grads stop moving here just for a $200k/year salary while spending none of their time outside of work and their expensive luxury apartment, we might actually see the people who participate in the city and spend money at local businesses be able to afford to live here.
